# Immi

Immediate mode user interface library.

* Immi doesn't draw for you, it only tells you what you need to draw. This is done through a
  trait named `Draw` which you must implement on whatever type you want.
* Immi is an immediate mode library, which means that the state of the UI is managed by you and
  not by the library. *You* choose what must be displayed in what situation.
